Convert Irish grid references to Irish Grid coordinates or a collection of simple features in an sf object, and vice versa.

All resolutions of Irish grid references are supported, from 100 km (e.g. "N") to 1 m (e.g. "N 87685 27487"). 

Irish grid references can be converted into point or polygon [sf](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) (simple features) objects of any coordinate reference system.

When converting to polygons, each polygon is sized to cover the full extent of the individual grid reference. Mixed resolutions are supported.

<!-- The Irish Grid is a metre-based coordinate reference system covering the island of Ireland. It is referred to as TM75 / Irish Grid and has been assigned EPSG code 29903. Irish Grid coordinates are a pair of numbers of the form x (easting), and y (northing). The resolution of the Irish Grid is 1 m. -->

<!-- The Irish Grid has been divided into 100 km squares. There are 25 squares. Each has been assigned a letter from A to Z, with the letter I skipped. -->

<!-- Irish grid references use the relevant letter followed by a pair of numbers to refer to a location. Valid grid references include N86, N8762, N876274, N87682748, and N8768527487. These represent squares of side 10 km, 1 km, 100 m, 10 m and 1 m respectively, all within the 100 km square N. -->


## Installation

You can install the development version of igr like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Converting from Irish grid references

Convert Irish grid references to Irish Grid coordinates:

```{r example-igr}
library(igr)

igrs <- c("A", "D12", "J53", "M5090", "N876274", "S1234550000", "W")

igr_to_ig(igrs)
```

Include the resolution of each grid reference in metres:

```{r example-igr-res}
igr_to_ig(igrs, res = "res")
```

Convert a list or data.frame of Irish grid references to an sf object of corresponding points:

```{r example-igr-df-p-sf}
p_sf <- st_igr_as_sf(data.frame(igr = igrs), "igr")

p_sf
```

```{r example-igr-p-sf-plot, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(maps)
library(tmap)

ie_uk_sf <- maps::map("world",
  regions = c("Ireland", "UK"),
  plot = FALSE,
  fill = TRUE
) |>
  sf::st_as_sf(ie_uk) |>
  sf::st_transform(29903)

tm_shape(p_sf, ext = 1.2) +
  tm_dots(size = 1, col = "cornflowerblue") +
  tm_text("igr", ymod = 1) +
  tm_shape(ie_uk_sf) +
  tm_borders()
```

Or convert Irish grid references to an sf object containing polygons, each polygon covering the full extent to which each grid reference refers:

```{r example-igr-s-sf}
s_sf <- st_igr_as_sf(data.frame(igr = igrs), "igr", polygons = TRUE)

s_sf
```

```{r example-igr-s-sf-plot, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
tm_shape(ie_uk_sf, bbox = s_sf, ext = 1.2) +
  tm_borders() +
  tm_shape(s_sf, ext = 1.2) +
  tm_polygons(size = 1, col = "cornflowerblue", alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_text("igr", ymod = -1)
```

## Converting to Irish grid references

Starting with a list of Irish Grid coordinates:

```{r example-igc-igr}
p <- list(
  x = c(0, 490000),
  y = c(400000, 0)
)

p
ig_to_igr(p)
ig_to_igr(p, sep = " ")
ig_to_igr(p, digits = 1)
```

Starting with a simple feature object:

```{r example-sf-igr}
p_sf <- sf::st_as_sf(data.frame(p),
  crs = 29903,
  coords = c("x", "y")
)

p_sf
st_irishgridrefs(p_sf)
st_irishgridrefs(p_sf, sep = " ")
st_irishgridrefs(p_sf, sep = " ", digits = "1")
```

Append Irish grid references for simple features in an sf object to itself:

```{r example-sf-b-igr}
p_sf$igr <- st_irishgridrefs(p_sf, sep = " ")

p_sf
```

Equivalent using tidy r, assuming the dplyr package is loaded:

```{r example-sf-t-igr, eval = FALSE}
p_sf <- p_sf |>
  mutate(igr = st_irishgridrefs(sep = " "))
```
