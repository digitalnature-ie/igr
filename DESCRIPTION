Description: Convert between Irish grid references and Irish Grid coordinates. Irish grid 
    references can also be converted to or from an 'sf' object in any coordinate reference 
    system. Precisions from 1 m to 100 km including 2 km (tetrads) are supported, as are 
    datasets with mixed precision. Conversion to 'sf' polygons is precision-aware.
